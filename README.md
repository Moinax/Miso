Miso
====

PHP client used to connect to the Miso api and extending OAuth.

Examples
--------

Copy the settings.php.dist in settings.php and complete the constants with your own values (got from http://gomiso.com)

You can then call the index.php

For the example, the session is used to store the token and token_secret, but you can of course use any other method.

Status
------

There is some missing api functions like removeFavorite, but the Api is fully functional and already used in http://nfyea.com

The example is fully working.
